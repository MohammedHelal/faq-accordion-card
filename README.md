## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Animations
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/) - React Build Tool

### What I learned

Working on this challenge taught me:
-How positioning affects overflow of the elements
-How to transform elements to different shapes
-How to make CSS animations.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on the three areas on future projects and challenges until I have a proper grasp of how they work.

### Useful resources

- [Ignoring Overflow of the parent divs](https://itecnote.com/tecnote/css-how-to-ignore-parent-elements-overflowhidden-in-css/) - This helped me make the box in the image of the desktop version ignore the overflow hidden and appear on top the the other elements.
- [CSS animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - This is an amazing tutorial that helped me get started and play around with animations, transitions and transformations.
